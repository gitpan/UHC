NAME

       UHC - "Yet Another JPerl" Source code filter for UHC script

SYNOPSIS

    In your script:

      use UHC;

    At command prompt:

      perl.exe     yourscript.pl  param1  param2 ...
      perl58.bat   yourscript.pl  param1  param2 ...
      perl510.bat  yourscript.pl  param1  param2 ...

DESCRIPTION

      This software is "Yet Another JPerl" written by Perl.
      We can write the script in UHC again.

      This is software that does the bridge from JPerl to Perl of the
      latest version.

      This software is still an alpha version for expressing a concept.
